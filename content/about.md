If curiosity has killed the cat, I should've been gone a while ago.
Instead, I tend to see life as a constant stream of opportunities waiting to be trialed and captured.

This approached led me to challenge many of my everyday beliefs from working hours and location to life hacks like [Minimalism](https://mnmlist.com/the-sweet-science-of-less-mail/)
and [Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-find-and-keep-joy/).
