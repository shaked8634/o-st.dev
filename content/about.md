If curiosity has killed the cat🐈, I should've be gone a while ago 😹. Instead I tend to see life as a constant stream 🚰 of opportunities waiting to be trialed and captured.

This approached led me to challenge many of my everyday believes from working hours and location to life hacks like [Minimalism](https://mnmlist.com/the-sweet-science-of-less-mail/) and [Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-find-and-keep-joy/).
